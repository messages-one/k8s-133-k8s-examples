KIND:       CSIStorageCapacity
VERSION:    v1

DESCRIPTION:
    CSIStorageCapacity stores the result of one CSI GetCapacity call. For a
    given StorageClass, this describes the available capacity in a particular
    topology segment.  This can be used when considering where to instantiate
    new PersistentVolumes.
    
    For example this can express things like: - StorageClass "standard" has
    "1234 GiB" available in "topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east1" -
    StorageClass "localssd" has "10 GiB" available in
    "kubernetes.io/hostname=knode-abc123"
    
    The following three cases all imply that no capacity is available for a
    certain combination: - no object exists with suitable topology and storage
    class name - such an object exists, but the capacity is unset - such an
    object exists, but the capacity is zero
    
    The producer of these objects can decide which approach is more suitable.
    
    They are consumed by the kube-scheduler when a CSI driver opts into
    capacity-aware scheduling with CSIDriverSpec.StorageCapacity. The scheduler
    compares the MaximumVolumeSize against the requested size of pending volumes
    to filter out unsuitable nodes. If MaximumVolumeSize is unset, it falls back
    to a comparison against the less precise Capacity. If that is also unset,
    the scheduler assumes that capacity is insufficient and tries some other
    node.

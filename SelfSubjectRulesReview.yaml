GROUP:      authorization.k8s.io
KIND:       SelfSubjectRulesReview
VERSION:    v1

DESCRIPTION:
    SelfSubjectRulesReview enumerates the set of actions the current user can
    perform within a namespace. The returned list of actions may be incomplete
    depending on the server's authorization mode, and any errors experienced
    during the evaluation. SelfSubjectRulesReview should be used by UIs to
    show/hide actions, or to quickly let an end user reason about their
    permissions. It should NOT Be used by external systems to drive
    authorization decisions as this raises confused deputy, cache
    lifetime/revocation, and correctness concerns. SubjectAccessReview, and
    LocalAccessReview are the correct way to defer authorization decisions to
    the API server.
